vs-project-dependency-graph
===========================

Visual Studio 2008, 2010 and 2012 project dependencies visualization and graph.

This is an improvement of [A Project Dependency Graph Utility for Visual Studio 2008 - The code Project](http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/37414/A-Project-Dependency-Graph-Utility-for-Visual-Stud).

Major features:

  - Displays a dependency tree like the one ReSharper gives you.
  - Generate Digraph for GraphViz and automatically call dotty and dot when available.
  - Can hide indirect dependencies.
  - Graph distingishes libraries from WinApp and ConsoleApp assemblies.
  - Simple and open source so you can fix or customize it.
